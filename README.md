# simple_reactnative_redux_todoApp
This app is very simple todo app with react-native and redux

- Actions are just three, addTodo, refreshTextInput, and clearTextInput.
- No filtering, No complete check function, so easier than [redux official todo-sample](https://redux.js.org/basics/example-todo-list)
- So this app may help those who could not understand redux pattern with react-native like me!
